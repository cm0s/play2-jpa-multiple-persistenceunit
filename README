# Play framework app + JPA with multiple persistenceUnit / DB

This is a play 2.1 sample application which show how to connect two different databases with the use of two
different persistenceUnits.

## What this sample do?
There is two actions in the Application controller which create and persist a User and a Company object in a H2
database with the use of the "defaultPersistenceUnit" and the "otherPersistenceUnit" declared in the persistence.xml
file.

## How to use this sample?
1. Clone this project
2. Start the application ($play run)
3. Use http://localhost:9000/test1 or http://localhost:9000/test2 to run one of the example.

A User and a Company object is persisted in the H2 memory database.

To browse the H2 database, use the $h2-browser command in the play console.

H2 databases can be replaced by other databases like MySQL. Just modify it in the application.conf and set the correct
hibernate.dialect in the persistence.xml file.
